        <h2>Our Glorious Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
            For far too long, we’ve languished under weak leaders, foolish policies, and idiotic mistakes. Under us, this ends immediately. As a party, we promise a complete reform of the way our nation is run, including major changes in:
        </p>
        <div class="grid">
            <div class="box a">
                <h3>The Heirarchy</h3>
                <p>Clear levels of power serve to prevent any confusion around decision-making.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box b">
                <h3>The Military</h3>
                <p>A strong military both protects us as citizens and unites us as a nation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box c">
                <h3>The Law</h3>
                <p>New and numerous laws will tie together our currently divided and broken country. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box d">
                <h3>Public Security</h3>
                <p>Under our leadership, safety and security will be permanently ensured through any means necessary.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>These four areas have remained outdated and poorly structured for far too long. The old outdated systems will be tossed out and replaced with newer, vastly more efficient methods of organisation.</p>
        <h2>The Hierarchy</h2>
        <h3>The first step in our transition to a great nation</h3>
        <p>It has long been understood by those who truly understand it that democracy is a flawed system. The people can all too easily be swayed more by powerful words than effective policies. Power should be handed to those who can wield it, not to those who can win the hearts of the populace. Under us, this fine nation shall have a single leader, chosen by the most capable minds of the Party. A man with infinite wisdom, compassion, and understanding. Our glorious leader, or with his real name:</p>
        <h3>Premier Jon Caesar (Big Jon)</h3>
        <p>We have every confidence that Premier Caesar will lead our nation to a bright future through his strength of character, charisma, and political ability. However, keeping such a capable leader to serve us does not come without its drawbacks.</p>
        <p>Allow us to make one thing clear. Democratic elections shall be removed permanently. We cannot afford to lose such an incredible leader to a petty change of heart among the people.</p>
        <p>There is no secret police.</p>
        <p>This fine nation shall become a single-party state, so as to better serve your needs and the needs of the country. The House of Toad naturally shall remain in power for the rest of eternity. The old system of ministers shall be stripped away to prepare for our new regime. The Minister of Defense shall be replaced with Field Marshal Harris, who shall also serve as the single most senior general officer of the British Armed Forces and police force, which shall be merged with the armed forces. The old, inefficient systems of ministers and Members of Parliament. Our glorious leader shall be advised by three people; namely Advisors Zubek, Lancaster, and Scarborough, who have each been specifically selected to fulfill such an important role due to their overpowering intelligence, resilience, and benevolence, something very few other politicians today prove to have. Other ministers of key areas, such as healthcare, education, and international development, will be removed from office and replaced with far more competent members of our own party.</p>
        <p>It is The House of Toad's pledge that, under the close supervision of our great leaders, safety, productivity, and happiness shall be restored eternally to the entire population of this great nation.</p>
        <h2>The Military</h2>
        <p>Never again shall our old government’s weakness and incompetence be mocked and warped into cruel and detestable memes by our neighbouring countries. New extensions, optimisations, and additions to our military will place us above all others in strength, size, and capability. The police forces of Britain, National Crime Agency, and British Transport Police shall each be merged with the British Armed Forces. This is in the hope of increasing ability for the four groups to integrate and reinforce each other, as well as easing that career path of someone wanting to switch between them.</p>
        <p>It has long been deemed necessary for a significant increase in the military power of our nation. We are falling behind when compared to the power of our American friends and Russian less-than-friends. This urgently needs to change. A small portion of the population, especially those who have worked in security, firefighting, and intelligence roles, shall be conscripted into the British Armed Forces. A grant of 800 million Pounds shall be given to the British Armed Forces in order to modernise our weaponry and equipment. Our current standard issue weapon, the L86, is cheap, yes, but also ineffective when compared to firearms such as the M16A4 and its variants, one of which, the M4 Carbine, is the standard issue weapon of the US. Our nuclear program is lagging behind significantly, and it would leave us open to attack in the event of the United States of America leaving our side. That too shall change.</p>
        <p>Following The House Of Toad’s restructuring of the British Armed Forces, Britain shall immediately withdraw from the UN. The UN had their chance to resolve conflicts, and they failed, instead leaving the settlement of disputes to powerful forces such as the US. But while the UN (at least in theory) seeks to help everyone, America does not have our best interests at heart. We have no choice but to expand our military if we wish to protect our assets, otherwise we will forever take a back seat in international affairs.</p>
        <p>There is no secret police. <span class = "polizei">Is there?</span></p>
        <p>Similarly, our navy and air force must also expand. We will order the commissioning of 21.5 new Warships to increase our marine dominance. In addition, 84 new military aircraft will be put into use, including twelve air superiority fighters and seven Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. These will assist in constant monitoring of the military capability of other nations, ensuring that we shall never be caught off guard by sudden militarization by other nations.</p>
        <h2>The Law</h2>
        <p>We cannot neglect this issue any longer: our current legal system is far too forgiving. Criminals that should be in a cell walk free, with little more than a few months’ community service, and because of this, our national reoffending rate is unacceptably high. Nothing less than a complete reformation of the justice system is acceptable. We have three main priorities to make this happen:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>More severe punishments - Deterrence and detention of criminals is key</li>
            <li>New court system and procedures - A small chance of innocence is not enough to warrant freedom.</li>
            <li>Removal of parole - Criminals do not deserve freedom until they have paid for their crimes</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These changes will serve to deter potential criminals, and if this fails, keep them from reentering society indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Major changes will also be rolled out to law enforcement units. With the previously mentioned merge of police and military forces, it would be a waste not to utilise that to its fullest potential. Units from the military on standby can be temporarily reassigned to law enforcement duties. Soldiers already comfortable with bullet-resistant armour and use of small arms can continue to use these when doing police work.</p>
        <p>In addition, several new laws shall be put forward:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Everyone’s favourite song must be “Big John”, by Jimmy Dean</li>
            <li>Chairs with less than six legs are not permitted.</li>
            <li>Spreading treasonous ideas (any idea Jon doesn’t agree with) is punishable by a prison sentence (death).</li>
            <li>Frivolous levels of CO2 emissions will be punishable by death, so Jon doesn’t die of global warming</li>
            <li>If your corpse produces too many emissions, you can AND WILL be executed again</li>
            <li>There is no secret police.</li>
            <li>Any doctors and chemists found not putting enough time and effort into finding cures for diseases or improving our country’s national health will be exterminated. This serves to motivate professionals into forwarding medical knowledge, thereby protecting Jon from harm</li>
            <li>Dangerous behaviour exhibited when in the immediate vicinity of our glorious leader will not be tolerated so as to prolong the lifespan of the great one</li>
            <li>Seriously, there is no secret police.</li>
            <li>Free school lunches for all primary school children.</li>
            <li>All stairs will be destroyed, to be replaced by slides and ladders</li>
            <li>Due to jon’s need to breathe fresh oxygen, any attempt to dispel the office plant will result in execution</li>
            <li>Toads can break any and all laws as the only being greater than a toad is Jon himself.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Public Security</h2>
        <p>In such a dangerous time, possibly on the brink of world war three, with America, Russia, and North Korea’s ever escalating disputes. Keeping this country safe is paramount. It is necessary to put forwards several changes to fulfill this difficult task.</p>
        <p>Firstly, any dissidence will not be tolerated. Spreading ideas contrary to the will of the state is not acceptable, nor does it help anyone. Any suspected insurgency will be quickly extinguished before the flames of dissidence can spread.</p>
        <p>Such problematic thought can be propagated in many ways. Disloyal media firms can publish articles throwing the actions of our government in an unfavourable light. To mitigate this, representatives of our government will be placed in each news firm, and will proof-read each article publication. All text messages will have to be submitted to these representatives and must be approved by them before one may text or tweet content of any kind. This rule does not apply to the posting of pictures of toads, as toads are the source of all truthfulness and purity. </p>
        <p>We anticipate that there will be many who seek to destroy us. The Communist Party have many dangerous and foolish ideas. These ideas they would wish to spread, even in failure, are rooted in pure detestable sloth and hubris. From the moment we take power, all activities regarding the Communist, Tommunist, and Cherwell Imperial parties will be prohibited. It may be necessary to cease the existence of the Liberal Party in the future as well. Their promises, motives and ambitions for the future of our country may seem desirable on inspection. However their sugar-coated lies are exactly that - lies. Despite their assurance that they only have your best interests at heart, if elected, they shall only seek self-centred and selfish fulfilments. They do not care about you, they only wish to better their own narrow-minded and shallow lives. But Jon does care about you. Jon loves you. Jon loves all. Jon is all.</p>
        <p>Some may tell you that we invade your privacy through intrusive and clandestine law-enforcement units. However, ask any one of us, and we can tell you with 100% confidence that there is no such thing. </p>
        <p>Es gibt kein Geheimpolizei, tam net sekretnoy politsii, and THERE IS NO SECRET POLICE.</p>
        <p>Any measures we may be forced to take that interfere with you daily lives in any shape of form, you must understand, regardless if this comprehension and trust is purely blind, that these measures are necessary and that any intentions we hope in fulfilling by these measures are rooted in your best needs and interests. We wouldn’t dream of doing anything to harm you. This blind trust in us may be necessary if you are to continue living in contentment. Just trust us. We wouldn’t hurt you. We are one in jon. Jon.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
